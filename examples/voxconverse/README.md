This is a **WeSpeaker** speaker diarization recipe on the Voxconverse 2020 dataset. It focused on a ``in the wild`` scenario, which was collected from YouTube videos with a semi-automatic pipeline and released for the diarization track in VoxSRC 2020 Challenge. See https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxconverse/ for more detailed information.

Two recipes are provided, including **v1** and **v2**. Their only difference is that in **v2**, we split the Fbank extraction, embedding extraction and clustering modules to different stages. We recommend newcomers to follow the **v2** recipe and run it stage by stage.
