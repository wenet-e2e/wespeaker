## Overview

* We suggest to run this recipe on a gpu-available machine, with onnxruntime-gpu supported.
* Dataset: voxconverse_dev that consists of 216 utterances
* Speaker model: ResNet34 model pretrained by wespeaker
  * Refer to [voxceleb sv recipe](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wespeaker/tree/master/examples/voxceleb/v2)
  * [pretrained model path](https://wespeaker-1256283475.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/models/voxceleb/voxceleb_resnet34_LM.onnx)
* Speaker activity detection model: oracle SAD (from ground truth annotation) or system SAD (VAD model pretrained by silero, https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad)
* Clustering method: spectral clustering
* Metric: DER = MISS + FALSE ALARM + SPEAKER CONFUSION (%)
