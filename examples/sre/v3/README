Changed a little in make_system_sad.py to make split a large data set in parts
when extracting VAD. It took ages to start otherwise and this will also be 
helpful in case there is a crash since output is saved after each part instead
of after the whole set.

# We use some scripts from Kaldi (combine_data.sh and fix_data_dir.sh)

# This should not be needed anymore.
# ln -s $KALDI_ROOT/egs/wsj/s5/utils
# export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/utils/ # This is necessary since some Kaldi scripts assume other Kaldi scripts exists in the path.
#export PATH=$PATH:$KALDI_ROOT/
