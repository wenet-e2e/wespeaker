          3D mask :math:`(N*num_heads, L, S)` where N is the batch size, L is the target sequence length,
          S is the source sequence length. attn_mask ensures that position i is allowed to attend the unmasked
          positions. If a ByteTensor is provided, the non-zero positions are not allowed to attend
          while the zero positions will be unchanged. If a BoolTensor is provided, positions with ``True``
          are not allowed to attend while ``False`` values will be unchanged. If a FloatTensor
          is provided, it will be added to the attention weight.
        - static_k: :math:`(N*num_heads, S, E/num_heads)`, where S is the source sequence length,
          N is the batch size, E is the embedding dimension. E/num_heads is the head dimension.
